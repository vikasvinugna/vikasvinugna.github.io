    <p>
      I'm Vikas Vinugna (pronouns: he/him/his), I completed my bachelors in CS in 2020 and worked for Cognizant Technological Services for 3 and a half years as a backend developer. My tech stack includes Java, SpringBoot, Hibernate, AWS, Jenkins, AzureTFS and React. Iâ€™m looking forward to learn more in React and integrating it with different backend technologies of web frameworks.
      I'm into kick boxing and also love racing karts.
      I play video games of most genres. Recently I completed Horizon zero dawn. Also I rank in the world's top 5% in F1 and Valorant.
      Over the winter break, I travelled back home to India. Spend most of time with my family and had some great food. Ohh man, I miss the food!.
